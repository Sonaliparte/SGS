## SGS – Housing Society Web App
This project aims to simplify maintenance fee tracking and receipt management for my 
housing society. I built a full-stack web app where residents can log in, view their dues, 
and track payments in one place. The goal is to eventually enable secure online 
payments and instant receipt downloads to improve transparency and reduce manual 
work.

# Tech Stack
- *React.js + Vite* – Frontend framework for a fast and responsive UI
- *PostgreSQL* – Relational database for storing user and payment data
- *Firebase* – User authentication and secure data access
- *Docker* – Containerization of the full app
- *Google Container Registry (GCR)* – Storing Docker images
- *Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)* –  backend deployment
- *Google Cloud SQL* – Managed Postgres instance for production

# Current Features
- *Resident Dashboard* – Users can log in and view their maintenance dues
- *Authentication* – Secure login and account management via Firebase
- *Feedback from* - For user feedback
- *Deployed on Kubernetes* – Full deployment on GKE with Docker and Cloud SQL

# Planned Features
- *Online Payments* – Integration with payment gateways for maintenance fee collection
- *Instant Receipt Download* – Auto-generate and provide downloadable receipts after payments
- *Email Notifications* – Automated reminders for due payments

# Architecture 

# What I Learned
- Creating full-stack web apps using React, Postgres, and Firebase
- Deploying on Google Kubernetes Engine with managed Cloud SQL
- Dockerizing the frontend and backend for consistent deployments
- Managing real-world data models for housing society needs

# Ideal For
- Personal/community software projects with real-world impact
- Resume/portfolio demonstrations of full-stack development + cloud deployment
- Projects involving Kubernetes, Firebase Auth, Docker, and SQL
